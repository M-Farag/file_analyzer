Just a dummy file with a few lines of text in it.
I'm going to use this to test the file reading and writing functions in the program.
This is the second line of text in the file.
This is the third line of text in the file.
This is the fourth line of text in the file.
This is the fifth line of text in the file.
This is the sixth line of text in the file.
This is the seventh line of text in the file.
This is the eighth line of text in the file.
This is the ninth line of text in the file.
This is the tenth line of text in the file.

It is for testing a simple file analyzer program that I'm writing.
